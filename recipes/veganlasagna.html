    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Despite its healthy and nourishing ingredients, this lasagna has comfort written all over it. Every bite is creamy, rich, and so satisfying.</p>
    <p>It’s also easy to put together and make ahead of time, so you can add it to your weekly dinner menu!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup dried lentils</li>
        <li>2 cups marinara sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup raw cashews</li>
        <li>14.5 ounce firm tofu</li>
        <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>3 cups baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 box lasagna noodles (about 12 noodles)</li>
        <li>2-3 cups shredded vegan mozzarella</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the red lentils. Add 1 cup dried red lentils and 3 cups of water to a medium pot. Bring to a boil, and then simmer for about 20 minutes. Drain the lentils in a fine strainer, and then add back to the pot and stir in the marinara sauce. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
        <li>Add the cashews to a food processor and process until fine and crumbly. Then add the tofu in chunks, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, salt, basil, oregano and garlic powder to the food processor. Pulse until well combined and pretty smooth. If it's too thick, add a few tablespoons of water to blend. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Add about 1 cup of lentil marinara to the bottom of a large 9×13 inch casserole dish. Spread it around evenly. Next add 4-5 lasagna noodles (uncooked). Spread half of the ricotta on top of the noodles. Top with half of the spinach. Add about 1 cup of the marinara sauce over the spinach, then place 4-5 lasagna noodles on top. Spread the rest of the ricotta over the noodles, then the rest of the spinach. Place 4-5 more noodles on top of the spinach, and then pour the rest of the sauce over the top, evenly. </li>
        <li>Cover tightly with foil and bake for 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the lasagna is cooking, make your Vegan Mozzarella Cheese, if using. Alternatively, use 2-3 cups store bought vegan mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>After 40 minutes, remove the foil and spoon on the mozzarella (or sprinkle the cheese all over). Place the lasagna back in the oven and bake for 20 more minutes, uncovered. Remove from oven, let cool for at least 15 minutes and serve.</li>
    </ol>
